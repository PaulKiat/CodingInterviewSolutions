## Problem Solving Steps

1. **Listen**: Carefully listen to the problem statement. Understand the requirements and constraints.

2. **Example**: Work through an example or two. This can help in understanding the problem better.

3. **Brute Force**: Think of a brute force solution first, even if it's not efficient. It provides a starting point.

4. **Optimize**: Look for ways to improve your solution. Think about time and space complexity.

5. **Walkthrough**: Go through your optimized solution step by step to ensure it covers all cases.

6. **Implement**: Code your solution in a clear and concise manner.

7. **Test**: Test your solution with various test cases, including edge cases, to ensure it works correctly.

### BUD Optimization

- **Bottlenecks**: Identify and address any part of your solution that significantly slows down the process.
- **Unnecessary Work**: Eliminate any redundant steps in your solution.
- **Duplicate Work**: Look for opportunities where you can reuse results instead of recalculating.
